# odin-restaurant-page

This project creates a restaurant page with a menu and all relevant informations regarding the restaurant.

Plan for this project:
Ultimately, the restaurant will be selling burgers. The image will display a set of enticing-looking 
burgers with the content becoming an overlay that covers it.


Create three main sections inside the content container.
- Header
- Main
- Footer 

Header: 
1. Have the title at the middle with the available options right beneath it.
    - Home
    - About
    - Menu
    - Contact

2. The main section will entail all stated options at the nav bar.
- Home:
    Have a photo of a burger joint that offers a wholesome and welcoming experience for the viewer.
    The underlying text will describe what the place is about and a brief description of what the place is about.
- About:
    This page will give more of a description of what the burger joint is about with when they founded etc...
    Elaborate on the history of the place and the promise it delivers to their customers.
- Menu:
    Menu items laid out in a row: 2 col: auto format. Each 'menu item' will have a photo of the burger and a charming
    description of the corresponding burger.
- Contact:
    An image displaying where to find the place and maybe the exterior of the joint.
    Phone num, address etc..
